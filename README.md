# McLaughlinUniversity

This project was developed in the Database Development 2 course at Durham College as a group of four with Daniel Hinbest, Ryan Clayson, Anna Nazarova, and Yash Gadhiya.
The topic is that McLaughlin University is a university where the donation system is basically using a series of Word and Excel documents, and needs to be replaced
with a formal database system. 

We developed a database application designed for the desktop for the university using C#, Visual Studio, WPF and a SQL Server database. 
This would allow the university to manage donations, donor information, and generate reports for the university.

To run the application, Visual Studio is required, and would need a local SQL Server database system. To use the database, the DataAccess.cs file will need to be
updated with the location of the database file on the computer in use.
